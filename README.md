# Project_D-GASM
After 3 months of data gathering from Twitter and more than half a million tweets, we have wrapped up our data science project. This is the result.

Between the candidates of the two major parties: Buhari of APC and Atiku of PDP, below is what our data revealed.

Thanks to this tireless team:
Francis Obasi, Nathan Clifford, Ayodele Osho, Taiwo Jackson, Adafin Joseph, Grace Aina, Onipede Emmanuel, Bamise Olowookere, Chigozie Njoku, Haleemah Oyindamola OLANASE, Michael Obiora, Tooritsemoshe Ojei, Olamide Onakoya, Ahmed Salau, Valentine Ezeja and Chinasa Ezeoke. They worked on data gathering religiously. I just handed the data a nice little mic.
